# AI Story Generator

## Description
This project is an AI-powered story generator built in Python.
It allows users to generate short stories based on genre and tone,
while enforcing narrative structure and character consistency.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenAI API
- Streamlit

## How it works
The application uses prompt engineering to control the AI output.
Stories follow a 3-act structure with a consistent main character
and a controlled tone.

## Features
- Genre & tone selection
- Structured story generation
- Simple web interface
- Reproducible prompts

## Limitations
- Stories may occasionally break coherence
- No long-term memory between stories yet

## Future improvements
- Persistent characters
- Story continuation mode
- Local LLM support
- Export to PDF

## Why this project?
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Integrate AI into a real application
- Design clean project architecture
- Control AI behavior through prompts
